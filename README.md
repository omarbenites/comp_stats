# Implementation of statistical methods.

This repository is for learning purpouses. It covers from set theory to more advanced methods in statistics.

## Computer representation of numbers

- [] Binary representation for Interger (`unsigned`, only naturals include 0; and, `signed`, naturals and negatives numbers)
- [] Binary representation for floating
- [] Binary representation for characters

## Set Theory

- [x] Union sets (in `R`)
- [x] Intersection sets (in `R`)

## Desc. Statistics

- [x] Mean (`media.cpp` and `variance.R`)
- [x] Varianze (`variance.cpp` and `variance.R`)
- [x] Standardization (`standardization.cpp` trough header files)
- [x] Range (`range.cpp`)
- [x] Percentile
- [x] Interquartile range

## Probabilty

- [ ] Bernoulli, Binomail and Uniform distribution (`R` and `cpp`)
- [ ] Poisson and Geometric distribution (`R` and `cpp`)
- [ ] Gamma and Beta distribution (`R` and `cpp`)

## Inference

- [ ] Sampling with replacement
- [ ] Sampling without replacement
- [ ] t test
- [ ] T.B.D
